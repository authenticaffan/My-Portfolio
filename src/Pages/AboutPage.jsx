      <p className="mt-4">üéì I&apos;m a final-year Computer Science Engineering student with a passion for full stack development, especially the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Over the course of my studies, I&apos;ve built a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which has allowed me to create user-friendly, dynamic web applications. I enjoy the challenge of turning ideas into real, functional solutions.
      <br /><br />  üíª In addition to web development, I&apos;m genuinely interested in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I believe these technologies will play a crucial role in shaping the future, and I&apos;m excited to dive deeper into their potential applications.
      <br /> <br />  ü§ù I&apos;m always open to connecting with others in the tech community, sharing ideas, and collaborating on exciting projects. If you&apos;re working on something impactful, let&apos;s connect and see how we can work together.</p>
